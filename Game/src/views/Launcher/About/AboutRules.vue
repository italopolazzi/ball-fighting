      <h2 class="display-1 mt-8">About</h2>
      <p>A game developed in JavaScript, Vue.js and Vuetify, in which two characters must compete to win the battle.</p>

      <h3>How to play?</h3>
      <p>Two characters with the same amount of health are placed at the ends of the canvas, the player must use the arrow keys to start the movement of his character. But beware! Take it easy. The characters should not attack each other initially, as they will lose the same amount of life when they collide with each other, which would result in a draw after the exhaustion of the 3 lives that accompany each one.</p>

      <h3>Okay, so what's the point?</h3>
      <p>For there to be a winner (and consequently a loser), they must collect effects that will appear at random times and positions within the field. the effects can be positive for the character or not. Among them there are some subcategories, each with its peculiarity, added to give dynamics to the battles.</p>

      <h3>Who controls the opponent?</h3>
      <p>
        Two game modes have been created:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a player versus the machine (using genetic algorithms)</li>
        <li>two players sharing the same screen and keyboard</li>
      </ul>
